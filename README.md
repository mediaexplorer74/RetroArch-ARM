# About

After long time of work I present to you this release of RetroArch for Windows (ARM) devices

With more than 70+ core, Cores are compiled for MSVC ARM


# Target

- It should work with Build: 15063+ (14393 with few cores)
- Supports UWP & WOA


# Improvements

This release contains the latest ANGLE library (by Google) that used to make OpenGL ES supported

Also I made many improvements for UWP functions,

and reverted back the uncompatbile functions for the lower builds.


# New Cores
- N64 
- ScummVM 2.6.0
- SEGA Dreamcast
