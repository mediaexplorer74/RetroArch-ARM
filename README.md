# About

After long time of work I present to you this release of RetroArch for Windows (ARM) devices

With more than 70+ core, Cores are compiled for MSVC ARM (UWP), some of them worked on WOA release

Including N64 core with Hardware render (Which is very rare)


# Improvements

This release contains the latest ANGLE library (by Google) that used to make OpenGL ES supported

Also I made many improvements for UWP functions,

and reverted back the uncompatbile functions for the lower builds.
